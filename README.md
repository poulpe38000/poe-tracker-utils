# Path of Exile Tracker Utils

This is just a small application to track your unlocked hideouts and your curretn incursion status in Path of Exile.

This project is mainly a training exercise for learning react, so nothing fancy :)

## The application

You will find the following sections on the application:

### Hideouts Unlocks
**Manage** your currently unlocked hideouts, with search and filter options so you can check where to **find a specific hideout**.

### Incursion Rooms
**Manage** your completed incursion rooms, and **keep track** of your current incursion, with the possibility to **validate** it once you completed it.

### Filter Editor
Not yet implemented.

### Import / Export
**Import** your tracker data from your saved tracker files (`.poetracker` file), or by pasting tracker data content.

**Export** your tracker data to a tracker file (`.poetracker` file), or as raw data.

Import and export both allow **partial imports/exports**.

## Data management

No user data whatsoever is stored on this app, everything is handled either by importing/exporting data from `.poetracker` files, or by activating the local storage in the settings.

We do not use cookies or trackers.

## Planned Evolutions

* Filter file editor
* Detailed stats for the imported tracker data
* Better header for both incursion and hideout trackers
