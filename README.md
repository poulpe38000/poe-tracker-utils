# Path of Exile Tracker Utils

This is just a small application to track your unlocked hideouts and your curretn incursion status in Path of Exile.

This project is mainly a training exercise for learning react, so nothing fancy :)

## The application

There are currently 2 main trackers :

### Hideouts Unlocks
Manage your currently unlocked hideouts, with search and filter options so you can check where to find a specific hideout

### Incursion Rooms
Manage your completed incursion rooms, and keep track of your current incursion, with the possibility to validate it once you completed it.

## Data management

No user data whatsoever is stored on this app, everything is handled either by importing/exporting data from `.poetracker` files, or by activating the local storage in the settings.

We do not use cookies or trackers.
